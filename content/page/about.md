I am a software engineer majoring in signal processing, especially **speech and audio processing**. Besides, I have experience with **frontend**, **backend**, **DevOps**, **firmware development** and the whole software engineering practices including CI/CD and testing. Now I am MS student in software engineering at CMU-SV.
